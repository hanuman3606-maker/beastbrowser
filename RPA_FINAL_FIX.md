## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why 2-Second Wait?
```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
```

**Reason:**
- Browser needs time to fully close
- Process cleanup takes ~1-2 seconds
- Extension files need to be released
- Without wait → Launch fails

### Profile State Sync
```
After close:
- profile.isActive updates
- State syncs with Electron
- 2 seconds ensures consistency
```

## 🎯 Script Running Checklist

If script still not running:

### Check 1: Extension Loaded
```
Browser → chrome://extensions/
Should see: "Beast Browser RPA Automation"
Status: Enabled ✅
```

### Check 2: Script Delay
```
Most scripts have 10-second initial delay
Wait at least 10 seconds after browser opens
```

### Check 3: Console Logs
```
F12 → Console
Should see:
- 🤖 Beast RPA Extension Loaded
- Script name logs
- Execution logs
```

### Check 4: Page URL
```
Check what page opened
Scripts run on all pages (websiteUrl is empty)
Should work on any site
```

### Check 5: Terminal Logs
```
Terminal should show:
- Extension created ✅
- Profile launched ✅
- Timer started ✅
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Already running" error persists
```
Solution:
1. Manually close all profiles
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Try RPA execution again
```

### Issue: Browser opens but nothing happens
```
Check:
1. F12 → Console for extension logs
2. chrome://extensions/ - is it enabled?
3. Wait 10 seconds (script delay)
4. Check terminal for timer logs
```

### Issue: Extension not loading
```
Solution:
1. Clear extension cache: clear-extension-cache.bat
2. Restart Beast Browser
3. Execute RPA again
```

### Issue: Script runs but wrong behavior
```
Check script content:
1. RPA tab → Click script → View code
2. Verify JavaScript is correct
3. Check for syntax errors
4. Test script in regular console first
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test Scripts First
```javascript
// Copy script to browser console (F12)
// Run manually to test
// Example:
setTimeout(() => {
  // Your scroll code
}, 10000);
```

### Tip 2: Check Script Output
```javascript
// Add debug logs to scripts:
console.log('Script started!');
console.log('Page height:', document.body.scrollHeight);
// Helps debug issues
```

### Tip 3: Extension Folder
```
Location: C:\Users\<USER>\BeastBrowser\ChromeProfiles\<PROFILE_ID>\BeastRPAExtension\

Check:
- manifest.json exists ✅
- rpa-script.js exists ✅
- Has your script code ✅
```

### Tip 4: Force Refresh
```
If extension seems stuck:
1. Close profile
2. Delete extension folder manually
3. Execute RPA again (recreates extension)
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Let Script Complete
```
Don't close browser manually during script
Let auto-close timer do its job
Ensures proper cleanup
```

### 2. Check Logs First
```
If issue, check:
1. Terminal logs
2. Browser console (F12)
3. Extension status
```

### 3. Wait for Delay
```
Scripts have 10-second delay
Don't expect instant action
Wait patiently
```

### 4. Test Simple First
```
Start with "🌐 Web Scroll"
It's simple and reliable
Then try complex scripts
```
