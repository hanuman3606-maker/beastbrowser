# Proxy Connection Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **SOCKS5 Proxy Connection Failed** - **CRITICAL FIX**: SOCKS5 now always uses local HTTP tunnel (prevents ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED)
2. **Timezone Leak (System Timezone Showing)** - **CRITICAL FIX**: Multi-layer timezone enforcement blocks system timezone completely
3. **Unsupported Flag Warnings** - Removed `--no-sandbox` and `--host-resolver-rules` flags, added `--test-type`
4. **ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED Error** - Fixed by enforcing tunnel-based approach for all SOCKS5 proxies
5. **Automation Banners Still Showing** - Added additional stealth flags to completely hide automation detection
6. **Profile Tracking Issues** - Ensured proper status reporting between frontend and backend
7. **Timezone Detection Issues** - Improved reliability of timezone detection from proxy IPs through tunnels

## Changes Made

### 1. Chrome139 Runtime (`electron/chrome139-runtime.js`)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: SOCKS5 now ALWAYS uses local HTTP tunnel (never direct connection)
  - Modified `buildProxyString()` to reject direct SOCKS5 and force tunnel usage
  - `launchProfile()` creates local HTTP proxy tunnel via `proxy-chain`
  - Chrome connects to `http://127.0.0.1:RANDOM_PORT` which tunnels to SOCKS5
  - This prevents "ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED" errors
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Multi-layer timezone enforcement (blocks system timezone leak)
  - Added `--tz=${timezone}` Chrome flag for process-level override
  - Set environment variables: `TZ`, `CHROME_TIMEZONE`, `ICU_TIMEZONE`
  - Priority: `profile.proxyTimezone` (auto-detected) > `profile.timezone` (user-set)
  - Works with timezone extension for complete override
- **REMOVED**: `--no-sandbox` flag (caused "unsupported flag" infobar warning)
  - Added `--test-type` flag to hide ALL Chrome warnings
  - Clean browser UI without any infobars
- **REMOVED**: Unsupported `--host-resolver-rules` flag
  - Replaced with `--proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback>` (cleaner approach)
- Improved proxy bypass configuration to only bypass localhost
- Enhanced automation detection bypass flags

### 2. Playwright Mobile Launcher (`electron/playwright-mobile-launcher.js`)
- Fixed syntax error in browser args array
- Added additional stealth flags to completely hide automation detection:
  - `--disable-automation`
  - `--disable-dev-shm-usage`
  - `--disable-features=site-per-process`
  - `--disable-blink-features`
  - `--disable-background-timer-throttling`
  - `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows`
  - `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`
  - `--disable-ipc-flooding-protection`
- Improved browser arguments filtering
- Enhanced proxy configuration consistency

### 3. Timezone Extension Builder (`electron/timezone-extension-builder.js`)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Complete `getTimezoneOffset` override with delete-then-redefine
  - First deletes native `Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset`
  - Then redefines as non-writable, non-configurable, non-enumerable property
  - Locks the function so system timezone CANNOT be accessed
  - Added debug console logging for verification
- Enhanced error handling with fallback mechanisms
- System timezone completely blocked at JavaScript level

### 4. SOCKS5 Handler (`electron/socks5-handler.js`)
- Improved connection reliability:
  - Increased timeout from 15s to 90s
  - Added keep-alive connections with 15s timeout
  - Reduced max sockets to 500 to prevent overload
  - Increased retry logic to 5 attempts for connection tests
- Enhanced timezone detection:
  - Added `worldtimeapi.org` as additional timezone detection source
  - Improved response parsing for multiple API formats
  - Added better error handling and logging
- Enhanced HTTP headers for more realistic requests:
  - Added `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Connection`, and `Cache-Control` headers
  - Updated User-Agent to match Chrome 139
- Improved SOCKS5 tunnel server configuration:
  - Added retryOnBlockedPage option
  - Added maxRequestRetries setting
  - Added requestTimeoutSecs setting
- Fixed proxy URL construction with explicit HTTP protocol
- Enhanced error logging and handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test SOCKS5 proxy connections with the updated handler
2. Verify that automation banners are no longer visible in both Chrome139 and Playwright browsers
3. Confirm that timezone is properly detected and applied from proxy location
4. Test profile status tracking to ensure UI updates correctly after launch/close
5. Use the test script (`test-socks5-connection.js`) to verify proxy connectivity independently

## Additional Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing API interfaces
- Improved error handling and logging throughout
- Enhanced reliability for production use
- Added comprehensive test script for troubleshooting
