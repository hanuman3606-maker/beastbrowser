## 🔍 DEBUGGING - If Not Working

### Check 1: Profile Has Starting URL

1. Edit Profile
2. Find "Starting URL" field
3. Enter: `https://duckduckgo.com`
4. Save
5. Try RPA again ✅

### Check 2: Script Content Not Empty

**Problem:** Save button doesn't work

**Solution:**
- Make sure script content field has code
- Paste from `SMOOTH_SCROLL_SCRIPT.js`

### Check 3: Profile Closed Before Execute

**Problem:** Script doesn't run

**Solution:**
1. Close profile first
2. Then Execute RPA
3. Profile will relaunch with extension ✅

### Check 4: Browser Console Logs

**Problem:** Want to see what's happening

**Solution:**
1. Profile launches
2. Press **F12** (DevTools)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for:
```
🤖 Beast RPA Extension Loaded
📍 Current URL: ...
✅ URL matches - executing script
🚀 Starting RPA automation...
🎯 SMOOTH SCROLL: Initializing...
```

### Check 5: Website URL Field

**Problem:** Script only works on specific site

**Solution:**
- **Leave Website URL EMPTY** ✅
- This makes script run on ANY site
- More flexible!

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES

### ✅ DO:

1. **Leave Website URL empty** for general scripts
2. **Set Starting URL in profile** (e.g., https://example.com)
3. **Close profile before Execute RPA**
4. **Check console (F12)** for logs
5. **Start with simple scripts** and test first
6. **Use ready-made scripts** (SMOOTH_SCROLL_SCRIPT.js)

### ❌ DON'T:

1. ~~Don't require Website URL~~ - Now optional ✅
2. ~~Don't execute RPA with profile already open~~ - Close first
3. ~~Don't leave Starting URL empty in profile~~ - Set it
4. ~~Don't skip console logs~~ - They help debug
5. ~~Don't paste broken code~~ - Test scripts first
