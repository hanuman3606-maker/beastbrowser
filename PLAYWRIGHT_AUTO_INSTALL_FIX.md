# ‚úÖ Playwright Auto-Install Fix

## Problem Fixed:
```
Failed to launch profile: Executable doesn't exist at
C:\Users\...\ms-playwright\chromium-1194\chrome-win\chrome.exe
```

**Mobile profiles (Android/iOS)** ab automatically Playwright install kar lenge first time pe.

---

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Created `playwright-installer.js`
- Checks if Playwright chromium exists
- Auto-installs if missing
- One-time 2-3 minute download

### 2. Updated `playwright-mobile-launcher.js`
- Added auto-install check before launching
- Shows clear error messages
- Handles installation failures gracefully

---

## How It Works Now:

### First Time User Opens Mobile Profile:

**Step 1:**
```
User clicks "Launch Profile" (Android/iOS)
```

**Step 2:**
```
App checks: Is Playwright chromium installed?
```

**Step 3 (If Missing):**
```
üì• Installing Playwright chromium...
‚è≥ This may take 2-3 minutes (one-time only)
[Download progress...]
‚úÖ Playwright chromium installed successfully!
```

**Step 4:**
```
üöÄ Launching mobile browser...
‚úÖ Profile launched!
```

### Next Time:
```
‚úÖ Playwright chromium found
üöÄ Launching immediately (no wait)
```

---

## Files Changed:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `electron/playwright-installer.js` | ‚úÖ Created - Auto-installer |
| `electron/playwright-mobile-launcher.js` | ‚úÖ Updated - Added install check |

---

## Testing:

### Test on Fresh Machine:

1. Build app: `npm run build:win`
2. Install on machine without Playwright
3. Create Android/iOS profile
4. Click "Launch Profile"
5. Should auto-install (first time only)
6. Profile launches successfully

### Verify:
```
Console shows:
üîç Checking Playwright chromium installation...
‚ö†Ô∏è Playwright chromium not found! Installing...
üì• This may take 2-3 minutes (one-time only)
‚úÖ Playwright chromium installed successfully!
üöÄ Launching mobile browser...
```

## User Experience:

### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå Error: Executable doesn't exist
User has to manually run: npx playwright install chromium
```

### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ Automatic installation
User just waits 2-3 minutes (first time only)
Then profile launches normally
```

---

## Build & Release:

### Next Build:
```powershell
# 1. Update version
# Edit package.json: "version": "2.0.4"

# 2. Build
Remove-Item build-output -Recurse -Force
npm run build:win

# 3. Test
.\build-output\win-unpacked\BeastBrowser.exe
# Try launching Android/iOS profile

# 4. Release on GitHub
# Upload .exe + latest.yml
```

## Important Notes:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è First Launch Takes Time
- Playwright chromium is ~170 MB
- Download time: 2-3 minutes (varies by internet speed)
- Only happens ONCE per machine
- Subsequent launches are instant

### ‚úÖ No Manual Steps Required
- Users don't need to run any commands
- Auto-install happens in background
- Clear error messages if installation fails

### üì¶ Build Size
- App build stays small (~200 MB)
- Playwright downloads on-demand
- Not bundled in installer

---

## Fallback:

If auto-install fails, user sees:
```
‚ùå Playwright installation failed: [error message]

Please run: npx playwright install chromium

Or download manually from:
https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers
```

---

## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Mobile profiles** (Android/iOS) ab kaam karenge!

**Test karke next release karo:** v2.0.4
