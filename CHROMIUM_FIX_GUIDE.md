# 🔧 Chromium Path Fix - Installation & Build Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem:** The application failed to launch on systems without Chrome installed because:
1. Puppeteer's bundled Chromium was not included in the build
2. No fallback logic to find Chrome/Chromium in system paths
3. `executablePath` was set to `undefined`

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Added `findChromiumExecutable()` function that searches multiple locations
2. ✅ Updated `package.json` to bundle Chromium with `asarUnpack`
3. ✅ Fixed all browser launch points to use detected Chromium path
4. ✅ Added proper error handling with user-friendly messages
5. ✅ Fixed SOCKS5 tunnel cleanup on errors
6. ✅ Fixed dev server auto-start in production builds

## 📦 How to Build with Chromium Bundled

### Step 1: Clean Install Dependencies

```bash
# Remove old node_modules and package-lock
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Fresh install (this will download Chromium)
npm install
```

**Important:** Make sure Chromium is downloaded during `npm install`. You should see:
```
Downloading Chromium r1108766 - 150.5 Mb
```

### Step 2: Verify Chromium is Downloaded

Check if Chromium exists:

**Windows:**
```bash
dir node_modules\puppeteer\.local-chromium
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ls -la node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium
```

You should see a folder like `win64-1108766` or `mac-1108766`.

### Step 3: Build the Application

```bash
# Build React app
npm run build

# Build Electron app with Chromium bundled
npm run build:win
```

### Step 4: Verify Build Output

Check the build output folder:

```bash
# Windows
dir build-output

# You should see:
# - BeastBrowser-Setup-2.0.4.exe (installer)
# - Or portable executable
```

The Chromium binaries should be in:
```
build-output/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Launch Without System Chrome

1. Rename your Chrome installation folder temporarily:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome -> C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome_BACKUP
   ```

2. Launch BeastBrowser

3. Create and open a profile

4. **Expected Result:** Browser should launch successfully using bundled Chromium

5. Restore Chrome folder after testing

### Test 2: Check Console Logs

When launching a profile, you should see:
```
🔍 Searching for Chromium executable...
✅ Found Chromium at: C:\path\to\chromium\chrome.exe
🚀 Launching browser with Chromium: C:\path\to\chromium\chrome.exe
```

### Test 3: Error Handling

If Chromium is not found (shouldn't happen with proper build), you should see:
```
❌ CRITICAL: Chromium executable not found!
💡 Please ensure Chrome/Chromium is installed or bundled with the app
```

## 🎯 Search Order for Chromium

The application searches for Chromium in this order:

1. **Puppeteer's bundled Chromium** (development)
   - `node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/`

2. **Unpacked Chromium** (production build)
   - `app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/`

3. **System Chrome** (fallback)
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`
   - Mac: `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/`
   - Linux: `/usr/bin/google-chrome`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Chromium not found" error after build

**Solution:**
1. Check if `asarUnpack` is in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "asarUnpack": [
     "node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/**/*"
   ]
   ```

2. Verify Chromium was downloaded during `npm install`

3. Rebuild with clean install:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build:win
   ```

### Issue: Build size is too large

**Expected:** The build will be ~150-200 MB larger due to bundled Chromium.

**This is normal and necessary** for the app to work without system Chrome.

### Issue: Slow first launch

**Expected:** First launch may take 5-10 seconds as Chromium initializes.

**This is normal** for Chromium-based applications.

## 📊 Build Size Comparison

| Build Type | Size | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Without Chromium | ~50 MB | ❌ Requires system Chrome |
| With Chromium | ~200 MB | ✅ Works standalone |

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Chromium Version:** The bundled Chromium is from Puppeteer's stable release
2. **Updates:** Update puppeteer package regularly to get latest Chromium
3. **Auto-Update:** Consider implementing auto-update for security patches

---

## 📝 Additional Fixes Included

1. ✅ **SOCKS5 Cleanup:** Tunnels are now properly cleaned up on errors
2. ✅ **Dev Server Fix:** Dev server no longer starts in production builds
3. ✅ **Error Messages:** Better user-friendly error messages
4. ✅ **Proxy Test Fix:** Proxy testing now uses detected Chromium path
5. ✅ **Timezone Detection Fix:** Timezone detection uses detected Chromium path

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before distributing to users:

- [ ] Clean install dependencies
- [ ] Verify Chromium downloaded (check node_modules)
- [ ] Build application (`npm run build:win`)
- [ ] Test on clean system without Chrome
- [ ] Verify profile launch works
- [ ] Test proxy functionality
- [ ] Check error handling
- [ ] Test SOCKS5 proxies
- [ ] Verify file size (~200 MB)
- [ ] Create installer/portable version

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Reduce Build Size:** Consider using `puppeteer-core` and bundling only required Chromium components (advanced)

2. **Faster Builds:** Use electron-builder's compression settings:
   ```json
   "compression": "maximum"
   ```

3. **Multiple Platforms:** Build for all platforms:
   ```bash
   npm run build:win
   npm run build:mac
   npm run build:linux
   ```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Chromium exists in build output
3. Test on multiple systems
4. Check electron-builder logs
