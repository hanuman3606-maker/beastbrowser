# 🎉 DUAL BROWSER SYSTEM - INSTALLATION & USAGE

## ✅ WHAT IS THIS?

**Smart Dual Browser Approach:**
- 📱 **Android & iOS** → Playwright (Perfect mobile emulation!)
- 🖥️ **Windows, macOS, Linux, TV** → Chrome 139 (Existing system)

---

## 📦 STEP 1: INSTALL PLAYWRIGHT

### Option A: NPM Install (Recommended)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\sriva\Downloads\Telegram Desktop\new version\beastbrowser-main"
npm install playwright
```

### Option B: Install with Chromium
```bash
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

**Note:** Playwright will download Chromium automatically (~100MB)

---

## 🔧 STEP 2: VERIFY INSTALLATION

```bash
npm list playwright
```

**Should show:**
```
beast-browser@2.0.3
└── playwright@1.x.x
```

---

## 🚀 STEP 3: BUILD & RUN

```bash
npm run build
npm run electron-dev
```

---

## 📱 HOW IT WORKS

### **Android Profile Launch:**
```javascript
// User creates Android profile
platform: "android"

// System automatically uses Playwright
→ playwrightMobileLauncher.launchMobile(profile)
→ Perfect mobile viewport: 412x915
→ Real Android user-agent from android.txt
→ Touch events enabled
→ Mobile version of websites ✅
```

### **Windows Profile Launch:**
```javascript
// User creates Windows profile  
platform: "windows"

// System uses Chrome 139
→ chrome139Runtime.launchProfile(profile)
→ Desktop viewport
→ Windows user-agent from windows.txt
→ Full desktop experience ✅
```
