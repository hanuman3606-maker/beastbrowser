## 🔴 CRITICAL BUGS (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. **Chrome Browser Path Dependency Issue** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Application fails to launch on systems without Chrome installed  
**Location:** `electron/main.js` line 1094, 1102

**Problem:**
```javascript
executablePath: undefined,  // Line 1094
const browser = await puppeteerExtra.launch(launchOptions);  // Line 1102
```

The software uses `puppeteer` which requires Chrome/Chromium to be installed on the system. When you build and distribute the app, if the user doesn't have Chrome installed, the browser fails to launch with error: "Chrome browser path not found".

**Root Cause:**
- `puppeteer` package downloads Chromium during `npm install` but this Chromium is NOT bundled with the electron-builder output
- The `executablePath` is set to `undefined`, so it tries to find Chrome in system paths
- When distributed, the bundled Chromium is missing from `node_modules/.local-chromium/`

**Solution Required:**
1. Bundle Chromium with the application using `asarUnpack` in electron-builder config
2. Set explicit `executablePath` to the bundled Chromium location
3. Add fallback logic to find Chromium in multiple locations

**Files to Fix:**
- `electron/main.js` - Add Chromium path detection logic
- `package.json` - Update build configuration to include Chromium
- `electron-builder.json` - Add asarUnpack for Chromium binaries

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY BUGS

### 2. **Missing Error Handling in Profile Launch**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** App crashes when profile launch fails  
**Location:** `electron/main.js` line 1044-1102

**Problem:**
The `launchProfile` function has a try-catch block but doesn't properly handle all error scenarios. If Chromium is not found, the error is not caught properly.

**Solution:**
Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages.

---

### 3. **Proxy Test Creates Multiple Browser Instances**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Memory leak and resource exhaustion  
**Location:** `electron/main.js` line 1900-1908

**Problem:**
```javascript
const testBrowser = await puppeteerExtra.launch({
  headless: true,
  args: [...]
});
```

Every proxy test creates a new browser instance. If user tests multiple proxies rapidly, this creates memory leaks.

**Solution:**
- Reuse a single headless browser instance for all proxy tests
- Add proper cleanup and timeout handling
- Implement a queue system for proxy tests

---

### 4. **SOCKS5 Tunnel Not Cleaned Up on Error**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Port conflicts and resource leaks  
**Location:** `electron/main.js` line 1074-1086

**Problem:**
If profile launch fails after SOCKS5 tunnel is created, the tunnel is not cleaned up properly.

**Solution:**
Add try-finally block to ensure tunnel cleanup even on errors.

---

### 5. **Timezone Detection Creates Unnecessary Browser Instances**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Slow profile launch and resource waste  
**Location:** `electron/main.js` line 667-703

**Problem:**
```javascript
const testBrowser = await puppeteerExtra.launch({
  headless: true,
  ...
});
```

For every profile launch with proxy, a temporary browser is created just to detect timezone. This is extremely inefficient.

**Solution:**
- Cache timezone data per proxy
- Use direct API calls instead of launching browser
- Only detect timezone once per unique proxy

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS

### 6. **User Agent Uniqueness Not Guaranteed Across Sessions**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** User agents may repeat after app restart  
**Location:** `electron/main.js` line 33, 99-123

**Problem:**
```javascript
const usedUserAgents = new Map(); // Line 33
```

The `usedUserAgents` Map is stored in memory and resets on app restart. This means user agents can repeat across sessions.

**Solution:**
- Persist used user agents to disk
- Load on startup and save on profile creation

---

### 7. **No Validation for Proxy Input Format**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** App crashes with malformed proxy input  
**Location:** Frontend proxy input handling

**Problem:**
No validation for proxy format before passing to backend. Invalid formats cause crashes.

**Solution:**
Add regex validation for proxy format: `host:port:username:password`

---

### 8. **Hardcoded API URLs**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Cannot switch between dev/prod environments easily  
**Location:** `src/services/beastBrowserService.ts` line 4

**Problem:**
```javascript
const BEASTBROWSER_API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1';
```

Hardcoded localhost URL won't work in production builds.

**Solution:**
Use environment variables for API URLs.

---

### 9. **Missing Chromium Version Check**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Compatibility issues with old Chromium versions  
**Location:** `electron/main.js`

**Problem:**
No check for Chromium version compatibility.

**Solution:**
Add version detection and warning if Chromium is outdated.

---

### 10. **Dev Server Auto-Start in Production**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Unnecessary process spawn in production builds  
**Location:** `electron/main.js` line 2005-2016

**Problem:**
```javascript
if (!devServerProcess) {
  try {
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const cmd = process.platform === 'win32' ? 'npm.cmd' : 'npm';
    devServerProcess = spawn(cmd, ['run', 'dev'], {...});
```

Production builds try to start dev server which doesn't exist.

**Solution:**
Only attempt dev server start in development mode:
```javascript
if (!app.isPackaged && !devServerProcess) {
  // start dev server
}
```

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY BUGS

### 11. **Console Debug Logs in Production**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Performance overhead and security concerns  
**Location:** Throughout `electron/main.js`

**Problem:**
Excessive console.log statements in production code.

**Solution:**
Use proper logging levels and disable debug logs in production.

---

### 12. **No Rate Limiting for API Calls**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Potential API abuse  
**Location:** All service files

**Problem:**
No rate limiting on API calls to external services.

**Solution:**
Implement rate limiting middleware.

---

### 13. **Missing Input Sanitization**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Potential XSS in notes/tags fields  
**Location:** Profile creation modal

**Problem:**
User input not sanitized before storage.

**Solution:**
Add input sanitization for all user-provided text fields.

---

### 14. **Incomplete Error Messages**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Poor user experience  
**Location:** Various error handlers

**Problem:**
Generic error messages like "Failed to launch profile" without details.

**Solution:**
Provide specific error messages with troubleshooting steps.

---

### 15. **No Telemetry for Crash Reports**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Cannot diagnose user issues  
**Location:** N/A

**Problem:**
No crash reporting or telemetry system.

**Solution:**
Implement Sentry or similar crash reporting.
